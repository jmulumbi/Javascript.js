//Lesson5:Operators 
//Addtion 
let a = 5 + 10;
console.log(a);
//Subtraction
let b = 10 - 5;
console.log(b);
//Multiplication
let c = 5*5;
console.log(c);
//Division
let d = 5/2;
console.log(d);
//Modulus
let e = 6 % 4;
console.log(e);
//Exponent
let f = 5**2;
console.log(f);

//Assignment Operators
let g = 4;
g+=4; //adds four
g*=4; //multiplies by 4
g/=4; //division by 4
g**=5; //4^5
console.log(g);

//Increment Operator 
let h = 5;
h++;//adds 1 
h--;//subtracts 1
console.log(h)

//Post Fix Operators

//Pre Fix Operators
let i = 10;
console.log(++i)//Incremented by 1 first then put on the console
let j = 5;
console.log(j++);
console.log();
